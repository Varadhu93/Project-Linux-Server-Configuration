# Project-Linux-Server-Configuration
This is the final project under Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree course. The project composes of deploying a Flask application onto a Linux server with all the essential softwares installed.

# Project Overview
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it.

# Why this Project?
A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, youâ€™ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.

# What will I Learn?
You will learn how to access, secure, and perform the initial configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. You will then learn how to install and configure a web and database server and actually host a web application
